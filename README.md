# Mesophotic.org: an information repository on mesophotic coral ecosystems

*Mesophotic.org* is a curated repository for information on mesophotic coral ecosystems, with the aim to provide an independent, open-source platform for and by the ever-growing mesophotic research community.  

The web application is written in Ruby (2.2.1) on Rails (4.2.0).

## Goals
* Collate available research focusing on the mesophotic depth zone, and make it accessible through a single webportal.
* Allow for the identification of knowledge gaps around particular taxa and geographic areas at mesophotic depths
* Provide a central place on the web for the exchange of scientific information and ongoing research efforts
* Act as an independent platform and shared resource for and by the mesophotic research community.
