# Mesophotic.org: an information repository on mesophotic coral ecosystems

*Mesophotic.org* is a curated repository for information on mesophotic coral ecosystems, with the aim to provide an independent, open-source platform for and by the ever-growing mesophotic research community.  

The web application is written in Ruby (2.5.0) on Rails (5.2.0) - see the [Gemfile](Gemfile) for a full list of gems.

## Goals
* Provide a comprehensive and dynamic record of all the published scientific information on these ecosystems and make it queryable through a single web portal
* Allow for the exploration of spatial/temporal trends and identification of knowledge gaps through curated metadata for each publication
*  act as an institution-independent platform and as a shared resource for and by
the research community to accelerate our understanding regarding the occurrence, composition and functioning of these ecosystems.

## Metadata

The primary entities in the database are scientific publications, for which standard citation data and associated metadata are indexed. [Click here](erd.pdf) for the entity relation diagram (ERD; generated with the `rails-erd` [gem](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd)).
