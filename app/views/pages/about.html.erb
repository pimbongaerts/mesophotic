    <h4>Mission</h4>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Collate available research</strong> focusing on the
        mesophotic depth zone, and make it accessible through a
        single webportal.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Allow for the <strong>identification of knowledge gaps</strong>
        around particular taxa and geographic areas at mesophotic depths
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Provide a central place on the web for the <strong>exchange of
        scientific information and ongoing research efforts</strong>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Act as an <strong>independent platform and shared resource</strong> for
        and by the mesophotic research community.

    <h4>Metadata</h4>
    <p>
      The primary entities in the database are scientific publications, for
      which standard citation data and the full-text contents are indexed. In
      addition, the following metadata are manually curated (and validated by
      at least 3 editorial members):
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Mesophotic</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publications presents data from, or presents a discussion on, the mesophotic depth range (<code>true</code>), or whether it is focused on another depth range (e.g. shallow or deep-sea) but relevant to mesophotic studies (<code>false</code>), and therefore included in the database. The mesophotic depth range is defined to be from 30-150 m.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Mesophotic Coral Ecosystem (tropical & subtropical) </strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publications presents data from, or presents a discussion on, a “mesophotic coral reef ecosystem (MCE)” as characterized by the following definition (altered from the Hinderstein et al. 2010 definition): “characterized by the presence of photosynthetically active corals, algae and associated communities at depths ranging from 30 to 150 m in tropical and subtropical regions” (<code>true</code>), or whether it is focused on an ecosystem that does not fall under this definition (<code>false</code>). The altered definition is to reflect the fact despite the “presence of light-dependent corals”, they are often a very small component of the overall ecosystem (particularly at lower mesophotic depths); additionally, while photosynthetically-active, the “dependence” on light may be debatable at lower mesophotic depths. Ecosystems that do not fall under this definition are those in Mediterranean and temperate systems (not subtropical/tropical), or azooxanthellate systems such as subtropical Oculina reefs (not a photosynthetically-active community).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Temperate Mesophotic Ecosystem</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publications presents data from, or presents a discussion on, a “temperate mesophotic ecosystem (TME)” (<code>true</code>), or whether it is focused on an ecosystem that does not fall under this definition (<code>false</code>).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Original data</strong>:

      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Reports new species</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publication includes the establishment of one or more new scientific names of species (<code>true</code>). Publications reporting on new species without establishing new scientific names for them are not included (e.g. undescribed, cryptic lineages discovered in a phylogenetic study) (<code>false</code>).

        <strong>Minimum depth</strong>:
        <code>integer</code> (in meters).

          <strong>2016-now: The second (latest) release</strong>:
          A beta version of the new mesophotic.org went on-line
          in June 2016, coinciding with the 13th International Coral Reef
          Symposium in Hawai'i (USA). This new version is backed by a
          relational database that contains extensive metadata on all of
          the listed publications, and offers searching across the full
          contents of the indexed publications.

          <strong>2012-2016: Wordpress & social media</strong>:
          Over the past several years, a simplified semi-static (Wordpress)
          version with just news items and a list of publications/abstracts
          replaced the original (databases-backed) website. Admittedly only as
          a temporary solution, however due to a lack of time a new back-end
          was not developed until 2016. Instead, there was an increased focus
          on using social media (Facebook and Twitter) to communicate news
          around mesophotic coral ecosystems.

          <strong>2008-2011: The original release</strong>:
          The mesophotic.org website officially went on-line in 2008 when it
          was first announced at the 11th International Coral Reef Symposium in
          Ft. Lauderdale (Florida / USA) and the International Collaborative
          Workshop to Prioritize Research and Management Needs for Mesophotic
          Coral Ecosystems in Jupiter (Florida / USA). The original website was
          started by Pim Bongaerts (The University of Queensland), with support
          from Felix Martinez and Lara Hinderstein (National Oceanic
          Atmospheric Administration - Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean
          Research). Over these initial years, the website received small
          grants from the Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research
          (CSCOR/NOAA), the Perry Institute for Marine Science (PIMS), the
          University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPR) and the Pacific Blue
          Foundation. The website eventually went down due to being hacked
          (and admittedly not the most secure PHP coding practises).
