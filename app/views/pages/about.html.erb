                        release of the new website.

      Apologies for the inconvenience, but for now expect some (= lots of) 
      bugs & mistakes!

    <h4>Mission</h4>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Collate available research</strong> focusing on the 
        mesophotic depth zone, and make it accessible through a 
        single webportal.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Allow for the <strong>identification of knowledge gaps</strong> 
        around particular taxa and geographic areas at mesophotic depths
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Provide a central place on the web for the <strong>exchange of 
        scientific information and ongoing research efforts</strong>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Act as an <strong>independent platform and shared resource</strong> for
        and by the mesophotic research community.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Metadata</h4>
    <p>
      The primary entities in the database are scientific publications, for 
      which standard citation data and the full-text contents are indexed. In 
      addition, the following metadata are manually curated, and validated by 
      at least 3 editorial members:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Mesophotic</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publications presents data from, or a discussion 
        on, the mesophotic depth range (<code>true</code>), or whether it is 
        focused on another depth range (e.g. shallow or deep-sea) but relevant 
        to mesophotic studies (<code>false</code>), and therefore included in 
        the database. The upper depth limit for the mesophotic range is 30 m
        with the lower depth limit determined by the presence of 
        light-dependent / photosynthesizing taxa (e.g. corals or macro-algae).
        A study on Mediterranean azooxanthellate corals at 80 m depth in a 
        habitat with macro-algae, is categorized as mesophotic 
        (<code>true</code>), but not as a "coral reef".

        <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Coral reefs (tropical & subtropical) </strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publication presents data from a (sub)tropical
        coral reef environment (<code>true</code>), or instead from a temperate
        environment (<code>false</code>).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Original data</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.
        Indicates whether the publication presents novel data 
        (<code>true</code>) or instead represents a review or meta-analysis 
        (<code>false</code>).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Reports new species</strong>:
        <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>.

        more new species (<code>true</code>). Publications reporting on new
        species without describing them are not included.

      <li class="list-group-item">

        rounding to obtain <code>integer</code>). Only given for publications
        that present `<em>Original data</em>`. Personal observations
        mentioned in the publication are not included.

          <strong>2016-now: The second (latest) release</strong>:
          A beta version of the new mesophotic.org went on-line
          in June 2016, coinciding with the 13th International Coral Reef 
          Symposium in Hawai'i (USA). This new version is backed by a 
          relational database that contains extensive metadata on all of 
          the listed publications, and offers searching across the full 
          contents of the indexed publications.

          <strong>2012-2016: Wordpress & social media</strong>:
          Over the past several years, a simplified semi-static (Wordpress) 
          version with just news items and a list of publications/abstracts 
          replaced the original (databases-backed) website. Admittedly only as
          a temporary solution, however due to a lack of time a new back-end 
          was not developed until 2016. Instead, there was an increased focus 
          on using social media (Facebook and Twitter) to communicate news 
          around mesophotic coral ecosystems.

          <strong>2008-2011: The original release</strong>:
          The mesophotic.org website officially went on-line in 2008 when it 
          was first announced at the 11th International Coral Reef Symposium in
          Ft. Lauderdale (Florida / USA) and the International Collaborative 
          Workshop to Prioritize Research and Management Needs for Mesophotic 
          Coral Ecosystems in Jupiter (Florida / USA). The original website was
          started by Pim Bongaerts (The University of Queensland), with support
          from Felix Martinez and Lara Hinderstein (National Oceanic 
          Atmospheric Administration - Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean 
          Research). Over these initial years, the website received small 
          grants from the Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research 
          (CSCOR/NOAA), the Perry Institute for Marine Science (PIMS), the 
          University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez (UPR) and the Pacific Blue 
          Foundation. The website eventually went down due to being hacked 
          (and admittedly not the most secure PHP coding practises).
